# Tutorial 7 Game Development

## Creating Sprint and Crouch Mechanics
1. Open the Player Script
2. Modify the player script to accept 2 new inputs (in my case R for sprinting and shift for crouching)
3. Add 2 new constants for sprinting and crouching speed
4. On Sprint input, set the speed to sprint speed
5. On Crouch input, set the speed to crouch speed and change player height to a constant created for crouching height
